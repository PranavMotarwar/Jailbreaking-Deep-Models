## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Quick Start
1. **Run in Colab**:  
   [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yourusername/jailbreaking-deep-models/blob/main/DL_project_3.ipynb)

2. **Local Execution**:
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Launch Jupyter notebook
   jupyter notebook DL_project_3.ipynb


üìä Task 5: Transferability Graph

Transferability Results
*DenseNet-121 performance across adversarial datasets.
PGD attacks show strong cross-model transferability.*

![DenseNet-121 Performance on Adversarial Datasets](Results.png)

**Key Observations**:
- **Original**: 74.80% Top-1 accuracy (baseline)  
- **FGSM**: Accuracy drops to 63.40% (-11.4% absolute)  
- **PGD**: Accuracy plummets to 53.60% (-21.2% absolute)  
- **Patch PGD**: Partial recovery to 71.00% (localized perturbations are less transferable)  

*Visualization shows adversarial examples crafted for ResNet-34 significantly degrade DenseNet-121 performance, demonstrating cross-model vulnerability.*

üìÑ Report Highlights

Key findings from Deep_Learning_Mini_Project_3.pdf:

Reduced ResNet-34 accuracy to 0.00% using PGD (Œµ=0.02)

Patch attacks (32x32, Œµ=0.3) achieved 41.20% Top-1 accuracy

FGSM perturbations transferred to DenseNet-121 with 63.40% Top-1 accuracy
